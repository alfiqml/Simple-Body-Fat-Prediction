# Simple-Body-Fat-Prediction
Predictive Modeling for Body Fat Percentage Using Python Machine Learning Algorithm (Linear Regression) and Flask

Introduction
This personal project demonstrates the prediction of Body Fat percentage Using Machine Learning Algorithm. This datasets that obtained from Kaggle provides estimates of body fat percentages using underwater weighing and body circumference measurements for 252 men. The dataset was created to facilitate the illustration of multiple regression techniques. Accurate measurement of body fat can be inconvenient and costly, making it desirable to have more accessible methods for estimating body fat.

Objectives
To build machine learning models using Multiple Linear Regression algorithm to predict body fat percentage.

To describe and discuss the parameters that make up each machine learning model.

Dataset
Data was made available by FEDESORIANO from Kaggle website. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset).
